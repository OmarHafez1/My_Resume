**Personal Projects** 

- [Competitive Programming Tool:](https://github.com/OmarHafez1/Competitive_Programming_Tool) Desktop app (Linux and Windows) That Compile and run the solution of competitive programmers and test it against some test cases. It also submits the solution automatically form the app itself and load the result of submission in the app. (Used by[` `**600+** user ](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95349)around the world till now). 

`     `**Using**: Java, Java swing and Java selenium web driver. 

- [Student Guide:](https://github.com/OmarHafez1/Student_Guide) Desktop app that shows some data for the students and calculate the GPA.
